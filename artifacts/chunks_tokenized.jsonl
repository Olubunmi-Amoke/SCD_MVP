The complement pathway is \nalso abnormal, with reduced opsonization of bacteria.\nSome treatments used in SCD also add to the immunodefi -\nciency.

Nearly all the evidence arises from studies of \nSCA (HbSS), and while it is currently recommended that \npatients with other types of SCD follow the same guide -\nlines, it is likely that there are important differences in the \nimmune function and pattern of infection seen in other \ncommon types of SCD, such as HbSC disease and HbS/ b \nthalassemia. For example, there is reasonable evidence that \nchildren with HbSC disease develop hyposplenism at an \nolder age than those with SCA and should follow different \nguidelines for prophylactic penicillin.138 Therefore, many \nquestions relating to infections in SCD remain unanswered \nand further work is needed. Poor outcomes associated with \ninfection in SCD are potentially modifiable with relatively \ncheap interventions focused on public health measures \nand the availability of antimicrobials.\nDisclosures\nNo conflicts of interest to disclose.\nContributions\nLEAS wrote most of the first draft of the manuscript. AM-N \nwrote the section on immune function. TNW wrote the sec -\ntion on malaria. DCR revised the initial draft of the manu -\nscript. All authors edited and approved the final version of \nthe manuscript."}

When possible, make these plans available in the electronic medical record.\n Refer to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute guidelines for the management of SCD: \nwww. nhlbi. nih. gov/health-pro/guidelines/sickle-cell- \ndisease-guidelines Primary Health Complaint: Extreme Pain\nPain crises, which can be excruciating, are the most common reason for ED visits among patients with SCD. Patients may not always appear to be in pain because they have often developed a high pain tolerance due to a lifetime of chronic pain. \nPatients with SCD require prompt pain treatment. The medical \nevaluation of patients includes determining the cause of pain and assessing recent medication use. For mild or moderate pain, begin treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For severe pain, treatment with opioids may be needed. If the patient is already on opioid therapy, calculate opioid dose based on current opioid dose. Reassess pain and provide additional opioid administration, if necessary, for continued severe pain. For greater effectiveness, medication can be combined with nonpharmacologic approaches, such as heat application and distraction.

Learn \nmore about CDC’s work to help people with SCD here: www. cdc. gov/ncbddd/sicklecellTIPS ABOUT \nSICKLE CELL DISEASE3\nChildren and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) \noften require care in the emergency department (ED) of hospitals and clinics for health issues related to SCD. The ED may be a patient’s only option for health care when symptoms, such as pain crises, cannot be managed at home or when a patient does not have access to a healthcare provider who specializes in treating SCD. The Sickle Cell Data Collection (SCDC) program found that in California, people with SCD seek care in the ED an average of three times a year from their late teens to their late 50s.<1average visit per year3average visits per year3average visits per year1average visitper year\n 0-16 years 17-39 years 40-59 years 60-80 years"}

Readers of this report should remember that this document is intended to provide guidance for \nmanagement, not to be rigidly prescriptive. The panel recognizes that the responsible clinician’s judgment \nregarding the management of patients remains paramount. Therefore, the Expert Panel Report is a tool to be adopted and implemented in local and individual settings, and to provide an opportunity for shared decisionmaking in which providers and patients are both fully engaged. \nThe EPR has been developed under the outstanding leadership of panel co- chairs Drs. George Buchanan and \nBarbara Yawn. The production of this report generated much discussion regarding the quality of the available \nscientific literature, its interpretation, and its pract ical application. In the end, priority was given to delivering a \ndocument that both objectively evaluated and organized the evidence and could be put into practice in the clinical setting, because effective implementation is ultimately what is needed to b ring about a change in \noutcomes. \nThe NHLBI is grateful for the tremendous dedication of time and the outstanding work of the expert panel, as \nwell as the advice of invited outside experts, the National Blood Disorders Program Coordinating Committee, and other stakeholder groups in developing this report. The invaluable comments from professional societies; voluntary health, government, consumer/patient advocacy organizations; and industry during the public review period greatly enhanced the scientific valu e and practical utility of this document. \nBy developing this landmark report, the expert panel has taken a tremendous step towards addressing the health needs of the person with sickle cell disease in the primary care setting. It is incumbent upon the team of health professionals caring for these individuals to change the landscape of care by providing this state-of-the- science \ncare. We are excited to be joined by all concerned in efforts to reach our common ultimate goal: improved health outcomes and quality of life for every person living with sickle cell disease. \nGary H. Gibbons, M. D. \nDirector \nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \nSusan B. Shurin, M.

Panel members were \nselected by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI’s) leadership. \nThe purpose of these guidelines is to help people living with sickle cell disease (SCD) receive appropriate care \nby providing the best science- based recommendations to guide practice decisions. The target audience is \nprimary care providers and other clinicians, nurses, and staff who provide emergency or continuity care to individuals with SCD. \nNHLBI sponsored the development of these guidelines to assist health care professionals in the m anagement of \ncommon issues, including routine health maintenance, the recognition and treatment of common acute and \nchronic complications and comorbidities of SCD, as well as the indications for and monitoring of hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapy. The guidelines address the care of infants, children, adolescents, and adults with SCD, with the goal of facilitating high -quality and appropriate care for all individuals with this disease. \nHistorical Perspective, Epidemiology, and Definitions \nSCD was first reported in the literature in November 1910 by James B. Herrick, who referred to “peculiar \nelongated and sickle -shaped red blood corpuscles in a case of severe anemia.”1 We have gained substantial \nknowledge about SCD since that first description.

Two effective disease-modifying \ntherapies for SCD —hydroxyurea and chronic transfusion—are potentially widely available but remain \nunderutilized.6-11 \nThe sickle cell mutation results in substitution of the amino acid valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position of the beta glob in chain, causing formation of hemoglobin S.\n12 More than 2 million U. S. residents are estimated to \nbe either heterozygous or homozygous for the genetic substitution. Most of those affected are of African \nancestry or self -identify as Black; a minori ty are of Hispanic or southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian \nIndian descent.13 It is estimated that between 70,000 and 100,000 Americans have SCD. Although SCD is \nassociated with major morbidity, currently more than 90 percent of children with SCD in the United States and \nthe United Kingdom survive into adulthood.14-16 However, their lifespan remains shortened by two or three \ndecades compared to the general population.17,18 \nThe most prevalent SCD genotypes (exhibit 1) include homozygous hemoglobin SS (HbSS) and the compound heterozygous conditions hemoglobin S β\n0-thalassemia (HbS β0-thalassemia), hemoglobin S β+-thalassemia \n(HbS β+-thalassemia), and hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC). HbSS and HbS β0-thalassemia are clinically very \nsimilar and therefore are commonly referred to as sickle cell anemia (SCA); these genotypes are associated with \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 1"}

Providing care to these \nindividuals can be challenging. As a result of the condition’s relative rarity, there are few health care professionals who are prepared to deliver continuity care or expert consultation for patients with serious acute or chronic SCD complications. These guidelines are therefore being made available to help provide the latest evidence- based recommend ations to manage this condition and to help engage health care professionals in \nsupporting their implementation at the practice level. \nOverview of the SCD Guidelines Chapters \nThis report begins with a chapter on comprehensive health maintenance. Many ch ildren and adults with chronic \ndiseases such as SCD do not receive the recommended preventive care provided to other children and adults. \nTherefore, the guidelines summarize recommendations for health maintenance screening, testing, and \nimmunizations as they apply to infants, children, adolescents, and adults with SCD. Generally speaking, recommendations for screening to facilitate primary and secondary prevention (e. g., asking a teen about smoking behavior or an adult woman about mammography, respectivel y) are often confused with \nrecommendations for evaluating early symptoms of a disease or condition. For this and most other documents such as the recommendations of the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), screening is considered testing or evalu ation for a relatively common condition for which there is effective therapy prior to symptom \nrecognition or during an asymptomatic phase.\n19 Generalized or universal screening is not recommended when \nexisting therapies have not been shown to improve patient outcomes when implemented in this early \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 2"}

Information on screening and preventive care is important for all clinicians who work \nwith individuals with SCD, including specialists who may serve as the continuity health care source for them. \nAcute complications are common at all ages in individuals with SCD and are addressed in the chapter, \n“Managing Acute Complications of Sickle Cell Disease.” Recurrent acute pain crises (also known as vaso -\nocclusive crises) are the most common manifestation of SCD. These crises occur, usually without warning, \nwhen obstructed blood flow results in ischemic tissue injury and pain. The vascular occlusion, generally at the \nlevel of capillaries and post -capillary venules, results not only from an accumulation of adherent and sickled \nerythrocytes, but also from alterations involving the vascular endothelium and adhesive proteins in the plasma \nand on white blood cells and platelets. The management of acute pain is central to the care of individuals w ith \nSCD, yet pain is often poorly or inadequately addressed in all types of health care settings. \nThese guidelines include recommendations for rapid and effective pain management in people with SCD who \npresent with such pain crises. Other significant ac ute complications addressed in this chapter include acute \nchest syndrome (ACS), stroke, splenic sequestration, acute renal failure, and cholecystitis. Neuropsychological, \neducational, and vocational impairment as well as common mental health issues such a s depression and anxiety, \nwhich often accompany chronic illness, were considered beyond the scope of this guideline work. \nChronic complications of SCD may occur as a result of acute episodes or as chronic or recurrent events.

Several \nof the most common of the chronic complications —including chronic pain, cholelithiasis, renal dysfunction, \npulmonary hypertension, and retinal problems—are addressed in the fourth chapter, “Managing Chronic \nComplications of Sickle Cell Disease.” \nEach of the two major therapies used in individuals with SCD—hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusions— \nare described in separate chapters (see “Hydroxyurea Therapy in the Management of Sickle Cell Disease,” and \n“Blood Transfusion in the Management of Sickle Cell Disease” ). These are the only currently proven disease-\nmodifying treatments for people with SCD. Both therapies are used in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Although neither has been shown to prevent all SCD- related organ damage, these treatment modalities can \nimprove the quality of life for individuals with SCD. Treatment with hydroxyurea is underutilized for many people with SCA who could benefit from it. Blood transfusion therapy has at times been underutilized, overutilized, or prescribed inappropriately for both acute and chronic complications. These two chapters provide guidance regarding the appropriate use of these therapies for SCD. \nProcess and Methodology \nThe expert panel first convened in the spring of 2009 to establish the vision and purpose of the panel, discuss the process and schedule for producing the guidelines, and determine the critical areas to be addressed. Prior to this meeting, the expert panel participated in a conference call to introduce the panel’s work and discuss the \noverarching questions that should be answered by the guidelines. Before beginning the writing of the guidelines \nreport, the expert panel divided its work into se ctions dealing with preventive care or health maintenance, \nrecognition and management of acute SCD -related complications, recognition and management of chronic \nSCD -related complications, and the two most broadly assessed and available disease-modifying the rapies for \nSCD, hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusions. \nWith the assistance of the methodology team and the supporting evidence center, the panel then developed key \nquestions and literature search terms to identify evidence. The field of SCD has a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or large prospective cohort studies to guide clinical decisionmaking ; \ntherefore, few of the recommendations in this document are based on this highest quality evidence.

Coordination models such as the medical \nhome can facilitate this coordination.33 Individuals with SCD are at high risk for developing multisystem acute \nand chronic conditions associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Undetected signs and symptoms can \nbegin in early childhood. For example, silent CNS infarcts can present with non-foca l signs such as \ndevelopmental delays or poor or declining school performance in children or changes in social role or work functioning in adults. Throughout their li ves, people with SCD should be considered for formal neurocognitive \nevaluation when assessments reveal any of these concerns. In another example, loss of the kidney’s ability to \nconcentrate urine occurs in most individuals with SCD and can result in large urine volumes. In children, this \nmay result in enuresis or bedwetting. \nAlthough treatment of SCD may ameliorate some of these complications, such therapies are often unsuccessful \nin completely preventing them.

The studies showed that \nprophylactic antibiotic therapy reduces the risk for pneumococcal infections in children with HbSS disease. \nThe three RCTs were of moderate methodological quality and compared penicillin to no prophylaxis. The \ninitiation of penicillin prophylaxis was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for developing serious \npneumococcal infections (2/105 vs. 13/110) and a nonsignificant reduction in mortality (0/105 deaths vs. 3/110 deaths; very low -quality evidence due to severe imprecision). A single trial evaluated the consequences of \ndiscontinuing penicillin prophylaxis; it suggested that prophylaxis in children who have not had a prior severe pneumococcal infection or a splenectomy may be discontinued at age 5.\n36 Children who continued penicillin \nhad a nonsignificant reduction in systemic pneumococcal infections; there was no effect on mortality. The \nobservational study compared penicillin to spiramycin and demonstrated that penicillin was superior. However, \nthe penicillin group had a higher rate of pneumococcal vaccination, confounding the eff ect of antibiotics and \nmaking strong conclusions difficult. The quality of evidence is very low due to severe imprecision (i. e., small number of events) and methodological limitations. Evidence is lacking in children with genotypes other than \nSS, even th ough many clinicians prescribe prophylactic penicillin for them both before and after age 5. \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 13"}

Chronic hemolytic anemias, including SCD, may result \nin pulmonary vascular changes leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and are placed in Group 1 of the current classification.\n44 This type of pulmonary hypertension may occur in up to 10 percent of those with \nSCA and accounts for 40–50 percent of all types of PH in SCD.45,46 The second most common type of PH in \nSCD is pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH), which is assigned to Group 2 in the current classification and is \nassociated with an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure (≥25 mmHg) but also an elevated pulmo nary \ncapillary wedge pressure of ≥15 mmHg.43-47 This is often associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction \nin SCD.48 PH also occurs in the setting of chronic lung disease, chronic thromboembolic disease, or can be due \nto unclear or multiple mechanisms (Groups 3, 4, and 5 of the classification, respectively). The main symptoms of PH include shortness of breath during routine activity, such as climbing two flights of stairs; fatigue; lethargy; \nchest pain; palpitations; syncope; peripheral edema; and decreased appetite.\n49 Distinguishing the etiology of \nthese common and diverse symptoms can be difficult. \nInitial assessment for PH has been done with an echocardiography evaluation to estimate pulmonary artery \npressure using tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV),43,45-47 but di agnosis requires right heart catheterization \nand direct measurement of the pulmonary arterial pressure and vaso- reactivity of the vessels.43,45, 50 Transient \nelevation in TRV has been observed during acute vaso -occlusive crises in individuals with SCD,51 which may \nnot reflect baseline values or represent chronic PH. \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 15"}

A similar false-positive rate (68 percent) \nwas noted in a cross- sectional study.60 The findings of a study evaluating right heart catheterization -confirmed \nPAH in persons with SCD showed that 44 percent of the people with PAH died compared to 17 percent of the people without PAH, and the median survival after diagnosis with PAH was 25.6 months (range: 1–46).\n61 \nNumerous studies showed that the prevalence of elevated TRV in people with SCD ranged from 11 percent to \n59 percent. This was much higher than in individuals without SCD and was associated with increased \nmortality.53,54 TRV increased over 2 years of followup, with the greatest increases occurring in the presence of \nelevated systemic blood pressure.62 The echocardiography studies assessing TRV did demonstrate several other \nabnormalities in individuals with SCD, such as increased left ventricle end -diastolic diameter, increased \nchamber size of the right ventricle and left atrium, early -diastolic mitral flow velocity and late -diastolic mitral \nflow velocity, and lowered ejection fraction (EF).63 Low EF was also found to be a significant independent risk \nfactor for death.53 No studies were found that demonstrated reduction in mortality in SCD using treatments for \nPH or to modify the S CD itself. \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 16"}

Do not screen asymptomatic children and adults with pulmonary function tests. \n(Moderate Recommendation, Low -Quality Evidence) \nReproductive Counseling \nBackground \nThe CDC and its partners released a set of recommendations and goals for preconception health.116 They \nrecommend that women and couples think about their goals for having or not having children and how to \nachieve these goals, known as a “reproductive life plan.” These recommendations apply to all women and couples, but, given the increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in SCD\n117 and the risk of maternal \nmorbidity and mortality,117,118 the expert panel determined that several recommendations were particularly \nrelevant for women with SCD and their partners. The “Recommendations” section delineates these. \nHeritabilit y In Men and Women With SCD \nPeople with SCD are at risk for having a child affected with SCD if their partners have SCD, β-thalassemia trait, \nor are carriers of other abnormal hemoglobins such as HbC. Women whose partners carry one of these traits can \navoid an affected pregnancy by undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). PGD is testing performed \non an embryo during an in- vitro fertilization cycle (see http://www. acog. org/~/media/For%20Patients/ \nfaq179. pdf? dmc=1&ts=20130718T1252201251 ).119 Alternatively, after spontaneous conception, prenatal \ndiagnosis of SCD is possible by chorionic villus sampling in the first trimester or by amniocentesis in the second trimester of gestation.\n115 \nFetal Anemia Due to Alloimmunization \nWomen with SCD are frequently exposed to blood products. The fetuses of women who are alloimmunized are \nat risk of significant hemolytic anemia or mortality. \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 23"}

Counsel women with SCD and their partners or refer for counseling about the following: \n(Consensus –Panel Expertise ) \na. Pregnancy in women with SCD is considered high risk, and there is an increased risk of adverse pregnancy \noutcomes including fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. \nb. Additional fetal surveillance is required dur ing a pregnancy. \nc. There are increased risks to a woman’s health during pregnancy. These risks include an increased frequency of pain crises and an increased risk of thrombosis, infections, preeclampsia, and death relative to women who do not have SCD. \nFor women who require chronic opioid therapy during pregnancy, there is an increased risk of neonatal withdrawal in their newborns. \nContraception \nBackground \nIn women with SCD, regular use of contraception can decrease the health risks associated with an unintended \npregnancy. Hormonal contraceptives may also decrease menstrual blood flow, leading to higher hemoglobin \nlevels. Use of progestin -only hormonal contraceptives lowers the risk of thromboembolism compared to use of \nestrogen -containing contraceptives and has been shown to be safe for women with SCD.127,128 \nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) and intrauterine implants carry modest risks associated with the insertion procedure, while sterilization carries risks associated with the surgical procedure. There is no evidence that IUDs pose an increased risk for women with SCD. \nSummary of the Evi dence \nPublished data about contraception and SCD were reviewed by the WHO prior to their latest publication of “Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use.”\n129 Eight studies were reviewed.130-137 With the exception \nof one survey,134 the studies were small and compared differences in hematologic parameters or numbers of \ncrises in women before and after starting a particular contraceptive, or between women who were or were not using a particular contraceptive. Progestin -only contraceptives were not associated with an increased risk of \nthrombosis and may have noncontraceptive benefits in terms of fewer crises and improved hematologic parameters. Data were insufficient on combined hormonal contraceptives. \nWomen with SCD may have additional considerations that need to be taken into account when assessing the \nsafety of contraceptive methods. For example, a history of stroke is a contraindication to combined hormonal \ncontraception, and by age 20, approximately 11 percent of untrea ted women with SCD have had a clinically \napparent stroke; this statistic increases to 24 percent by age 45.\n77 \nThe CDC adapted the WHO’s “Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use” for women with SCD, and \nthose criteria are the basis for the panel’s recommendations.21 \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 25"}

Evidence from \nRCTs and observational studies supporting the use of nonsteroidal anti-inf lammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was \nconflicting, but overall, the evidence supports their efficacy in reducing pain and decreasing length of hospital \nstay. Several RCTs and observational studies support the use of around -the-clock dosing of analgesics versus \nintermittent analgesic administration in treating VOCs.155-161 \nThe largest study on this topic, a prospective observational study in Saudi Arabia, included 1,154 people and \nexamined the effect of a pain management protocol.155 The study found that around-the- clock analgesic \ninfusions for the first 24 hours after admission were more effective for managing VOCs than “on demand” or patient -requested infusions of analgesics. People treated with around -the-clock analgesics achieved a higher \ndischarge rate within 72 hours of admission (83 percent), compared with people who received intermittent (per \npatient request) analgesics (71 percent). Other observational studies supported these findings and also suggested a more rapid resolut ion of VOCs and a strong patient preference for around-the- clock analgesic infusions. The \nevidence base was insufficient to make specific analgesic dosing recommendations or recommendations for several nonpharmacologic approaches (including oxygen, inhaled nitrous oxide, electrical nerve stimulation, acupuncture, biofeedback, and a day hospital program).

It is important for the patient and his or her primary care provider to know the baseline or “steady state” hemoglobin value to inform ongoing monitoring and management during acute complications. Baseline values are typically \n6–8 g/dL for people with SCA, 10–15 g/dL for people with HbSC, and 9–12 g/dL for people with HbS β\n+-\nthalassemia. \nAcute anemia, defined as a decline by 2.0 g/dL or more in hemoglobin concentration below the patient’s baseline value, can have diverse causes.

The \nhemoglobin value (typically 3 –6 g/dL ) is usually far below the person’s baseline level, and the reticulocyte \ncount is reduced or even zero. \nIt has been noted that people with SCD rarely have recurrences of aplastic crisis, and several people with SCD \nin the same household frequently develop aplastic crises simultaneously or sequentially. This pattern suggests an infectious etiology. In the early 1980s, it was shown that parvovirus B19, the cause of fifth disease in young children, is in fact the etiology of these events.\n238 This virus destroys erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, \nso people with an extremely short red blood cell lifespan such as those with SCA are susceptible to rapid decline \nin their hemoglobin concentration. Resolution of the aplastic crisis is heralded by marked reticulocytosis and rising hemoglobin concentration, concomitant with the appearance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies which neutralize the offending virus. The resulting humoral immunity is lifelong, preventing recurrent events. However, siblings or others with SCD who are exposed to a person with an aplastic cris is in the acute phase are \nat risk. Aplastic crises are most commonly seen in children with SCA. People with other genotypes, whose hemolysis is less severe, more often have clinically silent events. Occasionally, parvovirus B19 may also be responsible for or contribute to the development of ACS and/or stroke. \nOther Causes of Acute Anemia \nAcute splenic sequestration is a major cause of acute anemia, especially in children with SCA. This \ncomplication and the recommendations for its management will be described separately (see page 44). \nA decline in hemoglobin concentration below the baseline is a common feature of ACS and can be its initial \nmanifestation in a patient experiencing a VOC.

It is a major cause of acute anemia. During splenic sequestration, \nthe reticulocyte count and circulating nucleated red blood cells are usually elevated, and the platelet count is generally decreased because both red cells and platelets are trapped in the spleen. Sequestration usually develops without warning or known cause. It may occur as early as several months of age,\n239 although it is more \ntypical in chi ldren between the ages of 1 and 4 years old. Parents may note an enlarging mass in the left upper \nquadrant. Involution and autoinfarction of the spleen usually occurs by age 5, so sequestration events are less common in older children and adults with HbS S. In people with HbSS, the lifetime prevalence of acute splenic \nsequestration has been reported to be between 7 percent and 30 percent. In people with HbSC and HbS β\n+-\nthalassemia, splenic sequestration often occurs later in childhood or even during the adult years. Splenic \nsequestration in older patients is often accompanied by severe pain from splenic infarction, which can be documented by imaging studies.\n240 \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 44"}

In \nolder people, it may occur more insidiously.

In most cases, patients do not have a history of chronic organ failure. Deterioration is rapid and unexpected. It is usually associated with fever, a rapid decline in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count, and nonfocal encephalopathy. Acute respiratory failure is usually associated with development of A CS. Hepatic failure is \nassociated with marked elevations in total and direct bilirubin, liver enzymes, and blood coagulation screening \ntests. Acute renal failure is associated with a rapid elevation of serum creatinine, with or without the presence \nof oliguria and hyperkalemia.

Other coexisting complications may include rheumatoid arthritis and peptic ulcer disease.147,286 Common \nacute complications and their sequelae are described in the “Managing Acute Complications of Sickle Cell \nDisease” chapter in t hese guidelines. This chapter focuses on the chronic complications of SCD. Chronic \ncomplications of SCD can affect almost any organ, and certain acute complications, such as stroke and priapism, \noften evolve into chronic phases that require special approaches to management. \nThe phenotypic expression of chronic complications varies considerably among people, in the same person over \ntime, and among the various subtypes of SCD. Because the incidence of chronic complications seems to increase with age, und erstanding their pathophysiology, precipitating factors, and predictors may help prevent or \nminimize long- term morbidity. \nJust as the presentation and manifestation of chronic complications of SCD may vary, so have their definitions. Recently, a unified definition of each complication of SCD has been published,\n287 which may help stimulate \nfurther work to better describe and explain each complication. Without universal uniform definitions, the natural history of SCD complications and the effect of therapy will be difficult to determine. \nIn this chapter, recommendations related to the evaluation and management of the most common chronic \ncomplications of SCD are presented.

People with SCD experience both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Nociceptive pain is a hallmark of acute pain (see the “Managing Acute Complications of \nSickle Cell Disease” chapter). Chronic pain, including that described in people without SCD, is often associated \nwith neuropathic pain. The pathology of the transformation from chronic nociceptive pain to neuropathic pain is not well understood. The Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study (PiSCES) showed that adults reported chronic SCD pain at home during about 55 percent of the 31,017 days surveyed.\n145 Similarly, children reported SCD \npain at home on about 9 percent of the 1,515 days surveyed.288 In the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in \nSickle Cell Anemia (MSH), at -home analgesics were used for SCD pain on 40 percent of diary days and during \n80 percent of 2 -week followup periods, with oxycodone and codeine being used most frequently.289 \nThe major types of SCD- associated chronic pain include the following: \nChronic pain often of unclear etiology.

This type of chronic sickle cell pain may be an extension of recurrent acute painful episodes. Therefore, early and aggressive intervention in treating acute sickle cell pain may reduce the development of chronic pain. \nChronic pain in a specific tissue or organ, such as avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hips, or leg ulcers. Chronic SCD pain is usually desc ribed as constant and deep, nagging, and achy in nature. It can occur in \nthe chest, back, abdomen, extremities, neck, or head and is difficult to treat . \nChronic neuropathic pain. This is usually described as burning, numb, tingling, lancinating, shooting, or paroxysmal in nature and is associated with a sensation of pins and needles. Its severity is also enhanced by exposure to either cold or heat. This pain can be secondary to either peripheral or central nerve injury or nerve dysfunction. SCD- related neuropathic pain has two etiologies. The first is tissue damage secondary \nto occlusion of blood vessels that supply the nerves as can be found in mental nerve neuropathy and spinal cord \ninfarction .\n290-292 The second seems to be chronic pain. Persistent chronic pain, the resulting inflammation, \nand/or pain management seem to lead to neuropathic pain.286,293-296 \n“Breakthrough” pain is another type of pain often identified by health care professionals who treat patients with SCD. This term literally means the act of breaking through pain relief. Originally used to describe \npatients with cancer pain who were maintained on a stable dose of analgesics, breakthrough pain was defined as a flair -up of sudden pain unresponsive to usual therapy. Such a flare-up is usually sudden and \ninciden tal, and can last from a few seconds to a few hours. There are currently no data that clearly describe \nor can be used to define breakthrough pain in SCD.\n297 \nThe pathophysiology, management, and goals of treating chronic pain differ from those related to acute pain. Whereas the aim of acute pain treatment is to heal the acute process, the aim of chronic pain management is to \nrestore function and improve the quality of life. With the onset of chronic pain of unknown etiology, there seems to be a process of “rewiring” in the brain, where the threshold for pain perception is lowered so that \nambi ent environmental stimuli that are normally painless or mildly painful induce the perception of severe \npain.\n298 Chronic pain is often associated with other conditions that enhance its chronicity. These include \npsychosocial factors such as depression , anxiety, feelings of despair, insomnia, loneliness, helplessness, post -\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dependence on pain medications.23,293, 299 \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 56"}

Risk factors for AVN of the femoral head include SCD genotype, age, frequency of painful episodes, hemoglobin level, and \nα-gene deletion. The overall prevalence of AVN in SCD is about 10 percent, whereas in people with hemoglobin \nSS, it is about 50 percent by age 33.\n308,309 People with HbSS and concomitant α- thalassemia are at particular \nrisk.308,309 The SCD genotypes that are associated with relatively mild anemia, such as HbSS -α-thalassemia and \nHbSβ0-thalassemia, are at a particularly high risk to develop AVN at a younger age.308,309 \nAVN of the femoral head causes chronic severe pain and disability. The pain is generally worse on walking, \nrelieved by rest, and may be accompanied by a moderate or severe limitation of motion when the patient bears weight on the affected extremity. About 40–80 percent of cases of AVN of the hips are bilateral and, hence, \nevaluation of patients with AVN should focus on both hips.\n310 \nThe therapeutic approach to AVN depends on the stage of the disease. Ficat311 proposed a four -stage radiographic \nclassification of AVN of the hip based on plain radiography. MRI was not available at the time.

Hydroxyurea can reduce the frequency of sickle cell -related pain and the incidence of acute chest \nsyndrome (ACS). A brief overview of these complications will be presented. \nPain is the most common symptom of SCD. Pain can be acute, chronic, or an acute episode superimposed on chronic pain. Smith and colleagues\n145 collected daily pain diaries for 232 adults with SCD; pain was reported on \n54.5 percent of the more than 30,000 days analyzed. However, people sought medical care for pain on only 3.5 \npercent of those days. These data suggest that many people who have SCD may be undertreated for their pain, may not perceive a benefit of treatment, or may have learned to self -manage their pain. Understanding of the \nprocesses that lead to an acute vaso -occlusive pain crisis and the pathophysiology of the chronic pain syndrome \nremains limited. It is known that rigid red blood cells (RBCs) obstruct the microvasculature; however, a full understanding of how these events start and what role other factors play in this process—such as vascular adhesion molecules, leukocytes, re ticulocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets —has not been fully elucidated. \nWith the exception of the joint pain of avascular necrosis, chronic pain syndromes in SCD have not been \nstudied. In other chronic pain syndromes, central sensitization is thought to play a role.\n365 Hsieh and his \ncolleagues3 described four people on chronic daily opioid medications for sickle cell pain who were weaned off \nthese medications after successful stem cell transplants. This approach suggests the possibility that a reversible \nprocess may be resp onsible for the chronic pain that so frequently occurs in SCD. \nPulmonary complications are common in SCD. One of the most serious problems is ACS, which often follows an acute vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC) and can complicate many surgeries. The manifestati ons of ACS include \nfever, chest pain, hypoxemia, cough and/or dyspnea, and a new infiltrate evident on chest x ray involving at \nleast one lung segment.\n251 Potential etiologies of ACS include infection, bone marrow fat embolization, and in \nsitu sickling with pulmonary infarction. ACS causes significant morbidity and is associated with higher risk of \ndeath. ( For additional discussion of ACS, refer to page 46 in the “Managing Acute Complications of Sickle Cell \nDisease” chapter) \nSickle cell anemia (SCA) refers to the clinically similar disorders HbSS or HbS β0-thalassemia. Sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to all \ndisease genotypes, including SCA and compound heterozygous disorders, such as HbSC, HbSD, and HbS β+-thalassemia. The carrier \nstate for hemoglobin S (HbAS or sickle cell trait) is not a form of SCD. \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 71"}

One of the best examples is the profoundly favorable effect that high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) \nlevels have on preventing intra- erythrocytic hemoglobin S polymerization and vaso -occlusion. The beneficial \neffects of genetically determined, persistent elev ations of HbF levels in people who have SCD throughout their \nlifespan were documented through carefully conducted cohort studies in the 1970s and 1980s.142,366 These \nobservations supported the concept that therapeutic interventions to increase HbF levels could improve clinical \noutcomes, especially pain and ACS, in people who have SCD. For example, 5- azacytidine was found to be \ncapable of inducing HbF production in cell cultures, an effect confirmed in an animal model367 and in a few \npeople who had thalassemia or SCD. Other drugs capable of increasing HbF levels were sought to permit oral administration and more accepta ble toxicity profiles. \nHydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, was identified as a promising drug candidate to increase HbF levels in people with SCD. Prior to its use in SCD, this medication has been in use for several decades to treat people with myeloproliferative disorders. Hydroxyurea is known to have rapid absorption and near- complete \nbioavailability and to be therapeutic with once-daily oral dosing. The initial clinical trial of hydroxyurea for the treatment of SCA involved two people. The study showed that short- term hydroxyurea therapy increased the \nnumber of HbF- containing reticulocytes and was not associated with short -term toxicities.\n368 This favorable \nresult led to two carefully planned, extended studies testing the effects of hydroxyurea treatment in larger cohorts of people with SCA.

Limited data from observational studies are available on hydroxyurea therapy in people with genotypes other than HbSS or HbS β\n0-thalassemia. \nAlthough HbF induction is the most powerful effect of hydroxyurea and provides the biggest direct benefit for people who have SCD, additional mechanisms of action and benefits exist. For example, hydroxyurea lowers the number of circulating leukocytes and reticulocytes and alters the expression of adhesion molecules, all of which \ncontribute to vaso-occlusion.\n372 Hydroxyurea also raises RBC volume (higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV)) \nand improves cellular deformability and rheology, which increases blood flow and reduces vaso- occlusion. \nIn addition, nitric oxide released directly from hydroxyurea metabolism may contribute to local vasodilation.373 \nMethodology \nComplete information about the methodology for these guidelines can be found in the “Introduction and \nMethodology” chapter ( pages 1 –9). The f ollowing information, specific to this chapter, supplements the \nstandard methodology that was conducted for all clinical chapters of these guidelines. \nFor this chapter, all human studies in English published from 2007 to May 2010 that addressed the PICOS \nquestion were identified.

Although the protocol \ncontains several technical remarks and recommendations needed to implement hydroxyurea therapy safely and \neffectively, it should be considered as guidance and modified to fit an individual patient’s clinical situation (see \n“Consensus Treatment Protocol and Technical Remarks for the Implementation of Hydroxyurea Therapy”). \nAdditional Considerations \nGuideline developers consider what is known in the literature about people’s values and preferences and make \nassumptions about values demonstrated by people encountered in clinical practice.

For example, for this document, the expert panel defined recurrent SCD -associated pain to inclu de daily pain requiring the use of opioid medication. In addition, the expert panel \nalso includes those people who have episodes of pain, which, in the view of the patient and provider, significantly affect activities of daily living and quality of life. \nIt is the nature of most efficacy clinical trials to restrict enrollment to people with substantial clinical severity. \nUnfortunately, this limits data on the majority of people who do not fit easily into the restrictive clinical trial \ndefinitions— that is, the people who are seen in everyday practice. Notably, the pediatric phase III trial (BABY \nHUG)\n379 did not have specific inclusion criteria based on clinical severity; even infants with no previous clinical \nVOCs were eligible for enrollment. This was intentional and designed to allow the findings to be generalized to \nall infants and toddlers with SCA.380 \nThe panel deliberated extensively on using data from clinical trials alone, which in most cases would limit the use of hydroxyurea to people who have had three or more pain crises in the last year. However, the panel felt \nthat this would prevent the use of hydroxyurea in some adults who have chronic, acute, and recurrent pain, and \nfor whom observational studies have generally shown a benefit from the medication. Therefore, in an effort to \ninclude the broad range of pain syndromes that affect the ability of people with SCD to partici pate in their \ndesired daily activities, the panel’s definitions of chronic, acute, and recurrent pain and their recommendations for the use of hydroxyurea have been expanded beyond the eligibility criteria used in the clinical trials. Thus, \nthe expert panel believes that the use of hydroxyurea is indicated in a broader range of individuals than those \ndescribed in the inclusion criteria for MSH and hopes to encourage use of the medication in people who have acute and/or chronic pain that regularly interferes with their quality of life. \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 76"}

Although donor erythrocyte transfusion can ameliorate and even prevent SCD manifestations in select circumstances, transfusion of donor erythrocytes is not universally beneficial in SCD. Many of the recognized \nhazards of transfusion, such as the risk of alloimmunization, are amplified in SCD\n389; therefore, decisions to \nutilize transfusion therapy in SCD must be based on risk- benefit assessments. The goal of this chapter is to \npresent evidence -based recommendations that summarize the in dications, risks, and benefits of erythrocyte \ntransfusion therapy in SCD. \nBackground \nSickled erythrocytes possess many unfavorable physiologic properties and induce vascular changes that promote \nvaso-occlusion.

Many institutions provide all people with SCD with erythrocyte units that are sickle negative and leukocyte reduced; to prevent alloimmunization, many institutions \nalso routinely provide units matched for minor Rh and Kell antigens.\n390-392 The clinical benefits of transfusing \nsickle- negative RBCs in SCD (as compared to sickle trait RBCs) have not been specificall y studied. \nTransfusing sickle- negative erythrocytes assists with accurate tracking of percent sickled hemoglobin when \nspecific HbS targets are used and avoids the possibility of the transfused erythrocytes becoming sickled, which \nhas been described in ext reme circumstances.393,394 A specific request of the blood bank may be required to \nobtain sickle -negative erythrocytes. \nSickle cell anemia (SCA) refers to the clinically similar disorders HbSS or HbSβ0-thalassemia.

Episodic transfusion is used either acutely in response to a complication of SCD or prophylactically in preparation for anesthesia or surgery. Chronic transfusion is used when sustained, low levels of HbS are needed for primary or secondary prophylaxis \nfor SCD complications, most commonly stroke in children. Chronic transfusion programs may use different blood matching and monitoring strategies, although the themes of avoiding transfusion reactions, minimizing alloimmunization, maintaining low HbS levels, and tracking and treating transfusional iron overload are common among all programs.\n399 \nTransfusions can be lifesaving and protect organs from ongoing damage from sickled erythrocytes in the appropriate setting but also can cause serious and occasionally life-threatening complications. Judicious application of erythrocyte transfusion therapy in SCD requires an understanding of the evidence for erythrocyte transfu sion in specific clinical situations and an understanding of the additional risks of transfusion in people \nwith SCD. \nThere are many potential indications for transfusion in the patient with SCD.

In the four RCTs (with >1,100 patients), alloimmunization/autoimmunization development \nrates ranged between 3 percent and 29 percent.98,402, 405,406 In the other 63 studies (involving >6,000 patients), \nalloimmunization rates ranged between 6 percent and 85 percent, and autoimmunization rates ranged between 4 \npercent and 10 percent. Overall, minimal evidence is available to support a particular method to reduce or \nprevent side effects from RBC transfusion.407 \nThe systematic review did not identify comparative effectiveness studies that explored different cross-matching approaches. Two studies (one RCT and one observational study involving 159 patients) that implemented \nstricter matching criteria had more favorable results (alloimmunization rates <7 percent)\n408,409 The definition of \na “strict cross match” varied among studies, an d often included matching for ABO and a number of other RBC \nantigens, including DCcEe and Kell, and occasionally Kidd and Duffy.409 In the published studies, to prevent \nalloimmunization or to transfuse patients who were already alloimmunized, investigators most commonly opted \nto use strictly phenotype- matched RBC units. \nTransfusion Goals \nThe systematic review did not identify evidence supporting the effectiveness of a specific HbS percentage cutoff \nfor transfusion (i. e., there are no comparative studies in which different HbS targets were evaluated). In the \ntransfusion protocols used in the included randomized trials of patients treated with chronic transfusion, two (both in children) used a cutoff of ≤30 percent (STOP 1 and 2),\n96,98 while the remaining trial, which studied the \nuse of chronic transfusion in pregnancy, used a cutoff of hemoglobin between 10 g/dL and 11 g/dL405 and a HbS \ncutoff of ≤35 percent.

However, it is unclear how the use of these cutoffs correlates with \noutcomes.

Following an erythrocyte transfusion, if the donor erythrocyt es have a \ndifferent antigenic profile from those of the recipient’s own erythrocytes, an immunological response by the recipient against the “foreign” antigens can result in a process known as alloimmunization.

In patients with SCD requiring transfusion, what are the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of \nalloimmunization or autoimmunization? \nSummary of the Evidence \nThe systematic review summarized more than 60 longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, involving more than \n6,000 participants, in which alloimmunization or autoimmunization was described in adults and children with \nSCD undergoing transfusion. Rates of alloantibody formation ranged from 6 percent to 85 percent, while \nautoantibody formation ranged from 4 percent to 10 percent. These studies provide incidence and prevalence \ndata only, and none compared the effectiveness of preventive strategies. \nMost alloimmunization developed against erythrocyte antigen s in the Rh blood system (D, Cc, Ee) and other \nminor blood groups (e. g., Kell, Kidd, Duffy). Phenotype matching of these antigens between transfusion donor \nand recipient may lower the alloimmunization rate, with a reported rate of 0–7 percent described in studies \nwhere strict matching criteria were employed.\n408-411 \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 88"}

The vast majority of the iron is carried by hemoglobin within the erythrocytes. As a rough \ncalculation, 1 milliliter of erythrocytes contains approximately 1 milligram of iron, so for every 3–4 units of \npacked erythrocytes, 1 gram of iron enters the body. This process is clinically relevant, because adults normally have a total of only 4 –5 grams of iron in their entire body, so this amount increases quickly after repeated \ntransfusions. More importantly, there is no physiologic means to remove excess iron. Regulation of iron homeostasis normal ly occurs at the level of absorption through the hormone hepcidin, which inhibits the \ntransport of gastrointestinal iron into the body. Because transfused blood represents iron that circumvents the normal pathways of iron regulation, this excess iron accumulates in tissues and can become pathological. \nHemosiderosis is a condition that reflects a large iron burden affecting normal organ function. The liver, \npancreas, and heart are particularly vulnerable to iron overload. Chelation therapy can be used to remove excess iron. A number of different medications are used for chelation, but a thorough review of chelation dosing and management is beyond the scope of these guidelines. Deferoxamine is given by subcutaneous or intravenous \nroute and leads to iron e xcretion through both urine and feces, whereas deferasirox is given orally once a day \nand removes iron primarily through the gastrointestinal tract. Deferiprone is taken orally three times a day and \nrequires close monitoring due to the risk of agranulocytosis. Patients on monthly chronic transfusions typically receive chelation therapy to reduce iron burden, to attempt to normalize iron stores, and to avoid organ damage \nfrom hemosiderosis"}

Rather, SF is used as a biomarker to track qualitative trends of iron loading and chelation efficacy over time. Liver biopsy has been the gold standard in the diagnosis of iron \noverload but carries procedural risks and the possibility of sampling error. To avoid this invasive procedure, \nnew diagnostic tools using MRI have been developed; these tools image the whole organ to quantify liver iron. Data are limited on the sensitivity and specificity of these new technologies to quantify liver iron in individuals with SCD. However , a significant body of literature supports the use of MRI as a substitute for liver biopsy for \ndiagnosing iron overload in individuals with thalassemia.\n413 There is no reason to bel ieve that the quantification \nof tissue iron would be different in individuals with SCD, and there is literature where MRI was used as (1) a screening tool for identifying patients eligible to participate in a trial of chelation therapy (80 patients; Cappellini et al. 2010\n414), (2) a tool to monitor outcomes in a study of chronically transfused SCD patients (15 \npatients; Hernandez et al. 1988232), or (3) a tool in s tudies examining different chelation regimens (15 patients; \nVoskaridou et al. 2005; Cancado et al. 2009;415,416 Levin et al. 1995; Ghoti et al. 2010417,418).

Using a cutoff o f \n2,500 ng/mL, Karam et al.\n412 reported that SF had sensitivity of 62.5 percent and specificity of 77.8 percent for \nidentifying liver iron concentrations of 7 mg iron/g dry liver tissue or greater. One observational study defined \niron overload by liver iron concentration of at least 2.2 mg iron/g dry weight of liver tissue.422 Sufficient data \nwere not found to allow the estimation of diagnostic accuracy of MRI, although many chelation studies used \nMRI findings as inclusion criteria. \nHemolysis \nBackground \nHemolysis (the breakdown and destruction of donor erythrocytes) can occur during or after a transfusion. It is \nimportant to note that the mechanism of transfusion-related hemolysis is immunologic, in contrast to the hemolysis of sickled erythrocytes, which is an intrinsic red cell defect. Most transfusion- associated hemolysis \noccurs 1 to 4 weeks after red cell transfusion and is called a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). \nDHTR is related to immune -mediated mechanisms. The most common pathophysiology is preexisting or new \nIgG alloantibodies that bind to the erythrocytes and lead to accelerated clearance by macrophages in the \nextravascular compartment within the spleen, liver, marrow, and other parts of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). If the antibodies also fix complement, then erythrocyte destruction is further accelerated through lysis \ndirectly within the intravascular compartment. Both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis are manifest by \nshortened red blood cell survival, worseni ng anemia, and increased titers of antibodies found either on the \nerythrocytes themselves (positive direct antiglobulin, or “Coombs” test) or in the serum (positive indirect \nantiglobulin test) after the transfusion. \nDHTRs can be associated with hyperhemo lysis or bystander hemolysis. In this life- threatening complication of \ntransfusion, patients will hemolyze not only the transfused blood but also their own RBCs, causing a profound \nanemia. This complication is recognized when the hemoglobin falls below p retransfusion levels and is often \nassociated with reticulocytopenia and a positive direct Coombs test suggesting autoimmune destruction of RBCs.\n423,424 \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 90"}

Protocols should be bas ed upon \nthe individual’s pain score and analgesic history. \nPartial exchange transfusion Removal of a volume of recipient blood less than the total \nblood volume and replacement with donor erythrocytes. \nPatient -controlled analgesia (PCA) A drug- delivery s ystem that uses an intravenous pump to \ndispense a preset dose of a narcotic analgesic when the patient pushes a button. The PCA dose allows the patient \nto administer a dose up to every 10 minutes if needed. \nAdditional basal or continuous background infus ions may \nor may not be required based upon the individual, analgesic history, and current needs. Orders are written to define the \nPCA dose administered and PCA time interval every time \nthe patient presses the PCA button. A lock out, or \nmaximum dose per hour, is also written as a part of the \nPCA orders. \nPEFR Peak expiratory flow rate. A measurement of how fast a \nperson can exhale. \nPosterior chamber of eye The space behind the iris and in front of the lens filled with aqueous humor. \nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) Testing performed on an embryo before it is transferred to the uterus to determine if it also carries a genetic abnormality when one or both genetic parents have a \nknown genetic abnormality. \nPriapism A sustained, unwanted, painful penile erection lasting 4 or more hours. \nPrimary care provider Internist, family physician, pediatrician, nurse practitioner, \nor physician assistant with a clinical focus on the provision \nof general health care for the patient. \nProliferative sickle retinopathy (P SR) Growth of new vessels that emerge from the retinal vasculature at the interface of perfused and nonperfused \nretina in response to vascular growth factors produced by retinal ischemia. Also known as sea fan. \nProteinuria Any urinary protein excretion g reater than normal (less \nthan 300 mg/day). \nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) An elevation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) (greater than 25 mmHg at rest or greater than 30 mmHg with exercise) determined by right heart \ncatheterization. \nSickle cell anemia Genotypes HbSS and HbS β\n0-thalassemia, which are \nassociated with the most severe clinical manifestations, are \ncommonly referred to as sickle cell anemia. \nEVIDENCE -BASED MANAGEMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE: EXPERT PANEL REPORT, 2014 103"}

Red blood \ncells, which contain a predominance of hemoglobin S, \nundergo shape change when low oxygen concentrations \ncause polymerization of the sickle hem oglobin. The \ndamaged red blood cells become rigid and inflexible, \noccluding blood vessels and inducing tissue ischemia, pain, \nand organ damage. This process is accompanied by an \ninflammatory response and shortened red blood cell \nsurvival. These alterations may result in a wide variety of clinical manifestations. \nSCD genotypes (exhibit 1) include homozygosity of the \nsickle hemoglobin gene (HbSS) and the compound \nheterozygous conditions hemoglobin S β\n0-thalassemia \n(HbS β0), hemoglobin S β+-thalassemi a (HbS β+), \nhemoglobin SC disease (HbSC), and other, much less \nprevalent combinations. HbSS, the most prevalent genotype, and HbS β\n0 are commonly referred to as sickle \ncell anemia (SCA) and are associated with the most severe clinical manifestations. \nSickle vasculopathy Multiple biological processes contribute to the pathogenesis of vasculopathy, including red cell sickling, inflammation and adhesion biology, coagulation activation, \nstasis, deficient bioavailability and excessive consumption \nof nitric oxide, excessive oxidation, and reperfusion injury \nphysiology. This leads to abnormal vascular tone and \nactivated, adhesive endotheliu m. \nSimple transfusion The infusion of donor erythrocytes without removal of \nrecipient blood. \nStuttering priapism Multiple self- limited episodes of priapism, each lasting less \nthan 4 hours. \nTranscranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) A noninvasive method of analyzing blood flow velocity in \nthe brain. \nTricuspid valve regurgitant jet velocity (TRV or TRJ) Transthoracic echocardiographic determination of pulmonary hypertension. Elevated pulmonary artery \npressure results require confirmation by right heart \ncatheterization . \nUrobilinogenuria The presence of urobilinogen (a metabolite of bilirubin) in \nthe urine . \nVaso -occlusive crisis (VOC) Pain resulting from tissue ischemia as a result of blockage of blood vessels, occurring in a variety of vascular beds, \nbut most commonly in the bone or bone marrow and \nrequiring analgesic medication.

Below are steps you can take for better heart health.\nKnow your numbers. Ask your provider about your blood pressure reading at each visit. Keep track of \nthis information and talk to your provider if your blood pressure reading is above 120/80 mm Hg.\nIf your blood pressure is higher than 120/80 mm Hg, your provider will likely prescribe blood pressure \nmedicine to lower your risk for complications. \nLearn more about safe use of medicines here: www. cdc. gov/SCD/medicinesLearn more about measuring your blood pressure here: www. cdc. gov/BP/measure\nIf you have high blood pressure, you can help lower it by doing the following:\nBe physically active. Adults should get 30 minutes of exercise, such as brisk walking \nor bicycling, 5 days a week. Children and adolescents should get 1 hour of physical activity every day. Learn more ways to be physically active here: www. cdc. gov/physicalactivity\nEat healthy. Talk with your healthcare team about eating a variety of foods rich in \npotassium, fiber, and protein, and low in salt (sodium) and saturated fat. Learn more about healthy eating and nutrition here: www. cdc. gov/nutrition \nQuit smoking. Smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart \nattack and stroke. Your doctor can suggest ways to help you quit. Learn more about tobacco use and quitting here: www. cdc. gov/tobacco \nLimit how much alcohol you drink. \nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend \nup to 1 drink per day for women and up to 2 drinks per day for men. Learn more here: www. cdc. gov/alcohol \nGet enough sleep. Make sure to get 7 hours of sleep or more every night.

Executive Summary\nThe hemoglobinopathies are a group of disorders passed down through families (inherited) in which \nthere is abnormal production or structure of the hemoglobin molecule. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one \nsuch blood disorder caused by the abnormal hemoglobin that damages and deforms red blood cells. \nThe abnormal red cells break down, causing anemia, and obstruct blood vessels, leading to recurrent \nepisodes of severe pain and multi-organ ischemic damage. SCD affects millions of people throughout \nthe world and is particularly common among people whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa, \nregions in the Western Hemisphere (South America, the Caribbean, and Central America); Saudi Arabia; \nIndia; and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Greece and Italy. There is no widely available cure \nfor SCD although some children have been successfully treated with blood stem cell, or bone marrow, \ntransplants.1 However, hematopoietic stem cell transplant is not widely done for SCD, because of the \ndifficulty in finding a matched donor. Therefore, the number of people with SCD who get transplants is \nlow. In addition, there are several complications associated with the procedure, including death in about 5 \npercent of people. In SCD, clinical severity varies, ranging from mild and sometimes asymptomatic states \nto severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Symptomatic treatments exist, and newborn screening \n(NBS) for SCD can reduce the burden of the disease on affected newborns and children. \nThalassemia is another type of blood disorder that is caused by a defect in the gene that helps \ncontrol the production of the globin chains that make up the hemoglobin molecule.2 There are two \nmain types of thalassemia:\n• Alpha thalassemia occurs when a gene or genes related to the alpha globin protein"}

History of Hemoglobinopathy Screening\nPrior to 1960s, Sickle cell disease (SCD) was diagnosed mainly through hematological studies and \nclinical manifestations. In the late sixties, only a few states screened some newborns for sickle cell \ndisease, among a handful of genetic disorders. In 1971, in response to pressure by African American \nadvocacy groups, the US government made sickle cell disease a scientific and health care priority \nby allocating funds for treatment and research. Several Sickle Cell Centers were created in the \ncountry, mainly associated with universities or medical centers, including some at medical schools \nof Historically Black College and Universities.8 In 1973, a survey of annual workloads of US state \npublic health laboratories known as The Consolidated Annual Report (CAR) showed that 12 state \npublic health laboratories had some form of sickle cell screening program. (Table 3-5, Consolidated \nAnnual Report, 1973).9 On May 16, 1972, under President Nixon, the US Congress signed into law \nthe National Sickle Cell Disease – Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act (Public Law 92-294).8 In 1975, the \nfirst universal newborn screening (NBS) program for SCD was implemented in New York on a pilot \nbasis.10 Subsequently, screening was adopted by the remaining states throughout the late 1980s and \n1990s and into the 2000s. Initially, screening was targeted for populations at risk, primarily African \nAmericans. However, the missed cases rate was higher than 30% due to difficulty in identifying an \ninfant’s race or ethnicity at birth and so universal screening was implemented.11 Later on, other \nhemoglobinopathies were acknowledged as important public health issues.\nSince infection from capsulated organisms caused high mortality and morbidity in children"}

NBS is the practice \nof testing every newborn for certain harmful or potentially fatal conditions that are not otherwise \napparent at birth. A sample is collected before the newborn leaves the hospital and identifies \nserious, life-threatening conditions before symptoms begin. Although such conditions are usually \nrare, they can affect a newborn’s normal physical and mental development. Early detection is crucial \nin NBS since intervention can prevent death or a lifetime of severe disabilities.\nAlong with the initial newborn screening goal to identify SCD, other hemoglobin disorders such as, \nbeta (β) and alpha (α) thalassemia have gained significant attention in recent years due to the rapidly \nchanging demographics in the US as a result of increased immigration. Hence, hemoglobin disorders \ncommon in other countries are being seen more frequently in the US.16\nAs it pertains to screening techniques, laboratories originally used citrate agar electrophoresis \nfor screening of abnormal hemoglobins in cord blood. The subsequent improvement in the \nhemoglobinopathy electrophoretic techniques, made it possible to screen newborns by using either \ncord blood or heel stick samples (dried blood spots).\nCurrently, the majority of hemoglobinopathy screening programs use a combination of isoelectric focusing \n(IEF) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as primary screening methods (Table 1). \nMany programs use second complimentary electrophoretic technique, HPLC, immunologic tests or DNA-\nbased assays to confirm specimens with abnormal screening results.13 See Table 1 for a distribution of \nlaboratories versus methods utilized.

Methodologies for Hemoglobinopathy Screening and Diagnosis\nVarious methods for hemoglobinopathy newborn screening and adult testing are employed by \nUS laboratories. Many programs traditionally used electrophoresis as the method of choice \nfor identification and quantification of aberrant hemoglobins.24 In more recent years, with the \nintroduction of universal screening of newborns, technology has emerged that is robust with high \nthroughput and greater sensitivity over electrophoresis.24,25 Many of the same methods used for \nscreening, such as Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) \nare also used for diagnosis. Some laboratories employ one or more methods in their protocol for \ndetection of hemoglobinopathies. Choice of method depends on the function of the laboratory and \nits testing algorithm. Molecular methods are emerging and are being utilized by some screening \nand diagnostic labs alike to obtain a more comprehensive analysis and determine the nature of the \nhemoglobinopathy and its clinical implications. Below are descriptions of methods used. Descriptions \ninclude traditional methods requiring a hands-on approach, more current procedures requiring \nautomation and lastly, molecular assays. \nIsoelectric focusing (IEF) \nIEF separates proteins in a gel medium that has a pH gradient consisting of ampholytes (zwitterions). \nWhen a high voltage is applied, narrow buffered zones are created with stable, but slightly different \npHs (Figure 2). Slower moving proteins migrate through these zones and stop at their individual \nisoelectric points (pI).3 In the case of hemoglobin, these migrate to a zone in the medium where the \npH of the gel matches the hemoglobin’s pI. At the pI, the charge of the hemoglobin becomes zero \nand ceases to migrate. The hemoglobin migration order of IEF is similar to alkaline electrophoresis. \nResolution is clear with differentiation of HbC from HbE and HbO and HbS from HbD and HbG \nrespectively. HbA and HbF are also clearly differentiated.24 With neonatal specimens, a distinct \nband representing acetylated HbF is readily identified and slightly anodic to HbA.26 Staining may be \nnecessary depending on the manufacturer’s recommendations. Gels may be read wet or dry and \nband identification is accomplished by comparison to migration patterns of known quality controls.26 \nThis method allows for greater precision and accurate quantification than standard electrophoresis. \nIt gives excellent resolution in addition to high throughput, but is also labor-intensive and time \nconsuming.3,24,26 An alternative method is needed to confirm or differentiate hemoglobin variants \n(bands other than HbF or HbA).26 Fast migrating bands (Hb Bart’s, HbH) can also be identified by IEF."}

Samples are applied to cellulose acetate agar gel \nand hemoglobins are separated by electrophoresis using an alkaline buffer (Tris-EDTA with Boric \nAcid) at pH 8.4.28 Each hemoglobin variant carries a different net charge so it will migrate at varying \nspeeds. Following electrophoretic migration, visualization of hemoglobin bands are accomplished \nthrough staining with Ponceau S, Amino Black and Acid Violet or other similar stains and compared \nwith known standards.3,26,28 Hemoglobins are quantified using densitometric scanning and the \nrelative percentage of each band is determined.26,28 This method yields rapid and reproducible \nseparation of HbA, HbF, HbS and HbC as well as other variant hemoglobins with minimal preparation \ntime.

For example, the S mutation in the beta-globin \nB (HBB) gene replaces an adenine with a thymine resulting in an amino acid change from a glutamic \nacid to valine. This change destroys the DdeI restriction enzyme recognition site. After amplifying a \n125bp fragment of the HBB gene, an aliquot of the PCR reaction is added to a mixture containing \nthe enzyme DdeI . After a prescribed amount of time, an aliquot of this reaction and a DNA molecular \nweight marker or DNA ladder is electrophoresed on an agarose gel. If the specimen has normal \nhemoglobin (HbAA), the enzyme cuts the DNA into 106bp and 19bp fragments. The 106bp band \nis visible, but the 19bp band is too small to see on the gel. If the only product seen is 125bp, both \nalleles have the S mutation (SS). The specimen would be considered to have both an A and S allele \n(AS) and is classified as a carrier if both the 125 and 106 bp bands are seen (Appendix A, Figure 1).32\nThe benefits of this method are that it is very easy to perform and analyze and is inexpensive \ncompared to the other molecular methods described below. The only instrumentation required is \na PCR machine, a water bath, an electrophoresis unit and a camera. It is a low throughput method \nbecause there are a number of manual steps and the amount of time it takes to complete the assay; \nhowever it is a good choice for laboratories that have a small number of samples to test. A limitation \nof RFLP is that partial restriction (incomplete cutting) of the DNA could result in a homozygous \nspecimen being interpreted incorrectly. A positive control of a known genotype is crucial to identify \nthis problem. In cases of a double mutation like SC, if the restriction enzymes do not have similar \nactivity conditions, two separate reactions are required."}

However \nas procedures advance, others become less ideal for screening. For example, HbS solubility test, \nalthough simple and easy to use, is characterized by false positives from other hemoglobin types \nand interfering substances that may be present in the sample. False negatives are commonly seen \nin patients with low hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. Other abnormal hemoglobins are not readily \ndetected and result interpretation can be difficult due to the subjectivity of the test.25 Lastly, the HbS \nsolubility test cannot differentiate between carrier and disease state for sickle cell disease.

Both have advantages and limitations, therefore each program \nmust examine them to determine which method is best for their lab. The optimal strategy is to \ncombine multiple methods to confirm abnormal initial results. The reason for this is what appears to \nbe a common trait on one method might actually be different on another. In these circumstances the \nreported result would be Hb variant trait. \nIsoelectric focusing has the advantage of allowing the reader to view as many as 80 hemoglobin profiles \nper gel. This is very beneficial in high volume laboratories. Variant bands are easily distinguished on a \ngel when compared alongside normal Hb FA profiles and appropriate controls. However, hemoglobin \nbands can leak into neighboring profiles, be poorly focused, distorted or contaminated creating subjective \ninterpretations. This can be overcome by having multiple analysts enter results followed by an experienced \nanalyst who makes the final call. It is also difficult to quantitate hemoglobin bands when reading IEF \npatterns. Gel preparations are also labor intensive, time consuming, and involve multiple steps. \nFigure 7.

Algorithms for Hemoglobinopathy Detection\nNBS programs have varying approaches to screening and reporting. Examples of this are provided in \nthe Appendices starting on page 34. However, the goal is the same, to screen for those individuals \nwho may be at risk for hemoglobinopathies. The basic screening process entails use of a primary \nmethod with some labs opting to use a secondary method depending on the type of hemoglobin \ninitially detected. Reporting follows based on the result obtained. Methods differ in the ability to \ndetect different hemoglobins, so understandably programs will also differ in what is typically reported \ndue to method limitations. Additionally, programs may have different distribution of hemoglobins \nreported based on differences in population. To illustrate these variations seen in populations \nnationwide, the top 20 phenotypes reported by a sample of programs are provided in Appendix D.\nUnknown Hemoglobin Variants\nInvariably, NBS programs will identify unknown hemoglobin variants which may or may not be \nclinically significant. Most hemoglobin variants do not cause serious health problems, with the \nexception of a few. National consensus has yet to be established to guide newborn screening \nprograms and clinicians in the follow up of infants with unidentified hemoglobin variants. Final \nidentification of unknown variants can be achieved through DNA analysis and consultation with a \nhemoglobin specialist for possible clinical implications. \nOnce a variant hemoglobin is identified through screening, it should be confirmed by a secondary or \nalternate method.

The initial conversation should be expected to raise anxiety, and cause \ndisappointment and sadness at a time of joy; it may also stir anger or denial. The messenger should be \nsomeone familiar with the clinical course of SCD in infants, young children and adults, and be able to \nanswer basic questions about SCD and ready to provide reassurance and support for the family. \nThe processes and algorithms for notification and follow-up often place the primary care service as \nthe medical home, presuming that staff is able to interpret screening results and take appropriate \nactions when a baby with a positive screen is reported. Reporting individuals with abnormal \nscreening results to a dedicated follow-up agency and/or sickle cell treatment center will increase \nthe timeliness of appropriate care. \nIn the best circumstances, each child with presumptive SCD should be assigned to one case \nmanager who handles the baby from screening test results through establishment at the medical \nhome and sickle cell treatment center, where available. \nNon-affected individuals: All parents should be informed about the results of newborn screening. \nInforming parents about results of newborn screening that carry no clinical significance should be \nhandled with calmness and reassurance. Algorithms for reporting and following up babies with \nHbFA on screening should not classify them as “Normal” or “Within Normal Limits;” they should \nbe reported as “No Abnormal Hb Found.” While FA is the Hb phenotype of most babies with no \nhemoglobin disorder, babies with FA may be found later to have mild to severe beta or alpha \nthalassemia or transfusion-dependent thalassemia.\n“Trait Counseling” of parents of heterozygous babies has become an integral part of newborn \nscreening programs for hemoglobin disorders. However, an FA baby may be born to parents who \nBOTH have sickle cell trait or, one may have sickle cell trait while the other is a carrier of another \nabnormal hemoglobin or beta thalassemia. Such parents can have a subsequent baby who has SS or \nanother type of SCD."}

Nigeria is recognised as the country with the highest burden of sickle cell disease globally. This \nstudy aimed at critically reviewing available literature on impact of sickle cell disease in Nigeria. A literature search was carried out on \nfour databases, and a total of 116 articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the critical review. It was observed that \nmajority of the studies were carried out in South-Western part of Nigeria (47.4%), whilst the North-East had the least number of \nstudies undertaken in this area, more than a quarter of the studies (27.6%) were related to hematologic and serologic screening. Major \nthemes that emerged from this review were morbidity and mortality; prevalence of sickle cell disease; issues relating to blood \ntransfusion; psychosocial impact; and anatomical dysfunction in sickle cell disease.

Rare variants such as \nhemoglobin SE, hemoglobin SD Los Angeles, and hemoglobin SG-Philadelphia have also been identified.4,5 Fully functional \nbeta-globin arises from the normal wild-type allele of the β- globin gene (HbA). Over 400 mutant alleles have been identified \nand are known to give rise to variant hemoglobin or thalassemia.6 Out of these, the allele for sickle cell disease has attracted the \ngreatest attention because of its frequency and the severity of sickle cell disease.7\nThe basic pathophysiology of sickle cell disease involves the de-oxygenation and polymerization of red blood cells, \nleading to deformation and hemolysis. This therefore gives rise to varieties of clinical manifestations such as acute pain \nepisodes and anemia.8 The hallmark of sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive crises, and it is the most common reason for \nfrequent hospital visits for persons affected with the disease.9\nSickle cell disease has been recognized by the United Nations General Assembly as a disease of global public healt"}

It accommodates 75% of all patients with sickle cell \ndisease and 70% of all sickle cell disease births globally, with some of the affected children dying before the age of 5 years.11 \nNigeria is believed to be the most sickle cell endemic country in sub-Saharan Africa with between 2% and 3% of the total \npopulation affected.12 This study aimed at critically reviewing the impact of sickle cell disease in Nigeria, alongside relevant \nInternational Journal of General Medicine 2023:16 3503–3515 3503\n© 2023 Adigwe et al.

The critical review strategy can help assess the impact of sickle cell disease holistically and provide policy \ndirection for government in improving the quality of care for individuals with the condition.\nMethods\nData Sources and Search Strategy\nA detailed literature search was undertaken to identify publications that focused on sickle cell disease in Nigeria. \nRelevant articles were searched, screened, and included in this study accordingly. Articles were searched through Web of \nScience, PubMed, Google Scholar, and African Journal Online using different combinations of keywords which includes \n“sickle cell disease”, “sickle cell anemia”, “Nigeria” “burden” and “impact”. All the four databases were carefully \nsearched for only English-language full-text original articles published. Titles and abstracts of the retrieved documents \nwere examined to identify those that were within the area of focus.\nReview Selection\nAfter the exclusion of duplicate literature, titles and abstracts of selected articles were carefully reviewed. All relevant \nfull-text studies obtained were assessed for eligibility. Original articles from peer-reviewed scientific journals with \nprimary data on various areas that focused on the impact of sickle cell disease in Nigeria were considered potentially \neligible for inclusion in this review. All studies outside Nigeria were excluded.\nData Extraction and Analysis\nData were extracted from the selected studies into an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2013). The variables \nregistered for each article were author, year of publication, name of the journal, and article title. Others include area of \nfocus, geopolitical zone, method of data collection and age range of subjects. Data were then imported into Statistical \nPackage for Social Sciences software version 25 for descriptive analysis, and results were summarized as figures.\nResults\nThe liter"}

Others include area of \nfocus, geopolitical zone, method of data collection and age range of subjects. Data were then imported into Statistical \nPackage for Social Sciences software version 25 for descriptive analysis, and results were summarized as figures.\nResults\nThe literature search undertaken across various databases yielded 4812 articles that were related to sickle cell disease in \nNigeria, and this covers between 1985 to 2021. After the elimination of duplicates, a total of 621 were retained. Following \ntitles and abstracts screening, up to 178 full-text articles were eligible for consideration. Finally, a total number of 116 full-text \narticles (See Supplementary Table 1 ) which met the inclusion criteria were selected for critical review.1,3–9,11,13–118 Further \ndetails on the search strategy are presented in Figure 1 .\nBibliometry\nSickle Cell Disease Studies by Geopolitical Zone\nFigure 2 shows the various geopolitical zones with their respective percentage of studies on sickle cell disease in Nigeria. It \nwas observed that a considerable proportion of the studies (55; 47.4%) were carried out in the South-West zone. A total of ten \nstudies were carried out each in North-Central, North-West, and South-South, whilst 20 studies were recorded in South-East.\nFindings in Figure 2 show that studies encompassing all the zones were relatively few as only two (1.7%) of the \narticles in this review captured all six geopolitical zones in their data collection process.\nSickle Cell Disease Studies by the Method of Data Collection\nFigure 3 gives a graphical illustration of sickle cell disease studies by the method of data collection. It was observed that \ndata from laboratory tests dominated under this category (49; 42.2%).\nFindings in Figure 3 indicate that only one of the articles’ data collection process was underpinned by the use of \ninterview. Studies involving questionnaires were of similar proportion with those that employed clinical investigation as \ntheir data collection strategy.\nhttps: //doi. org/10.2147/IJGM.

Taiwo et al reported a prevalence of \n2.4% for HbSS genotype in South-Western Nigeria.7 Similarly, Stephen et al reported a gradual increase in the \nprevalence rate of sickle cell disease in Jos, Nigeria, in 2013 and 2014.11 On the contrary, the case fatality rate for \nsickle cell disease gradually decreased from 15.4% in 2012 to 11.1% in 2013 and 10.3% in 2014. Other researchers that \nstudied children in North Central Nigeria identified 5% prevalence rate of sickle cell disease among the study \npopulation.28 However, Kingsley et al revealed a decline in prevalence of sickle cell disease from 2011 with the least \nprevalence reported in the years 2016 and 2017.29\nHematological and Serological Screening\nSome studies reported a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration and packed cell volume among patients with sickle cell \ndisease.30–32 Decreased mean cell hemoglobin and mean cell volume had also been reported among people with this condition.33 \nLow serum zinc levels as well as increased copper levels were prominent among patients with sickle cell disease.34\nA study among children affected with sickle cell disease revealed a decrease in Myeloperoxidase and \nMalondialdehyde.35 In a study"}

Also, evidence \nsuggests that blood transfusion services in some public hospitals had fallen short of best practices.39 There were reported \ncases of human immunodeficiency virus infections following blood transfusion among patients with sickle cell disease.40 \nInternational Journal of General Medicine 2023:16 https: //doi. org/10.2147/IJGM.

Nwadiaro et al identified \nStaphylococcus aureus as the leading cause of chronic osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease.53 The first \ndecade of life was reported as the peak age for incidence of chronic osteomyelitis.54 Osteonecrosis also constituted \nanatomic dysfunctions in sickle cell disease with multifactorial etiology.55 Factors associated with increased predisposi -\ntion to osteonecrosis of the femoral head are euglobulin clot lysis time, hemoglobin level, and co-existence of other \nvariants of abnormal hemoglobin like alpha-"}

Onyemaechi et al \nand Balogun et al studied the spectrum of musculoskeletal disorders in sickle cell disease.1,57 They revealed muscu -\nloskeletal complications as major root causes of morbidity and disability in people affected with the disease. They also \nhighlighted bacterial infections of bones and joints as a precipitating factor for osteomyelitis and septic arthritis.\nDiscussion\nInteresting findings have emerged from this critical review based on the methodological approach adopted. Majority of the \nstudies were undertaken in the South-Western part of Nigeria, and this was followed by the South-East zone. North-East had \nthe least proportion of articles, and this may be attributed to the current unrest caused by insurgency which has been ongoing \nfor over a decade in the region.123,124 The ongoing issues relating to the terrorism and insecurity in the North-East may have \nconstituted access and implementation challenges for scientists interested in working in that part of the country.

Interpersonal interview has been found to increase confidence as well as clinical outcomes for \npatients.49 It is, therefore, critical for more qualitative research be considered in undertaking studies that aim at better \nunderstanding sickle cell disease, with a view to improving its management.\nA considerable proportion of the studies focused on hematological and serological screening, and this could be due to the \nfact that sickle cell disease is primarily a blood disorder.31,58 Similarly, significant problems associated with white blood cells, \nplatelets, and coagulation in sickle cell anemia condition could be responsible for the extensive research in this area.30,59 \nAnother factor that could have contributed to the preponderance of research in this area could be the routine serologic \nevaluations of sickle cell patients’ body electrolytes, liver enzymes, as well as micro and macro nutrients.4,34,60–62 ,90\nSickle cell disease poses a serious burden to Nigeria’s health system and the society at large.63 In this study, various \npathophysiologic effects associated with this condition were identified.

Furthermore, leg ulcer was observed to be \ncommon among persons suffering from sickle cell anemia.67,68 Ulceration was believed to occur due to thrombi \nformation in small capillaries, which consequently results to ischemia. This phenomenon is further promoted by up- \nregulation of integrins by micro-thrombin which promotes platelets aggregation and adherence to the endothelium.4,60 \nAlso, the release of injurious cytokines, as well as conditions such as thrombocytosis and antithrombin deficiency, were \nidentified as other factors that may promote ulceration.69\nTherapeutic red blood cell transfusion remains a cardinal intervention"}

Proper screening of blood before transfusion is therefore critical in reducing \nthis occurrence. Additionally, awareness and educational interventions that improve knowledge regarding voluntary \nblood donation and screening for blood transmissible infections need to be encouraged.42,45\nFindings from this study revealed some psychosocial impacts of sickle cell disease.70 Societal attitudes and percep -\ntions were identified as triggers for major psychosocial issues among sickle cell disease patients. Impaired psychosocial \nhealth-related quality of life had been associated with a number of negative effects, including low self-esteem; anxiety \nand depression; a loss of interest in basic life activities.71,72 The need for active involvement of social workers in the \noverarching healthcare for persons with sickle cell disease cannot therefore be over emphasized. Government, non- \ngovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders involved in sickle cell care must also synergize efforts in improving \npsychosocial and socioeconomic support for individuals with sickle cell disease. This is especially fundamental in \nimproving access to health and quality of life for persons with sickle cell disease.73,74 Several of the clinical issues \nInternational Journal of General Medicine 2023:16 https: //doi. org/10.2147/IJGM.

Amongst them, acute chest syndrome is the leading cause of \nmortality . As a result, most providers are in tune with this complication and well versed \nwith management. As sickle cell patients now live longer , they face a multitude of other \ncomplications that if left unattended, can lead to significant morbidity and mortality as well. \nIt is critical to look beyond acute chest syndrome and adopt a more comprehensive approach \nto the management of the sickle cell patient. \nKeywords: sickle cell disease, acute chest syndrome, complications\nIntroduction\nSickle cell disease (SCD), an inheritable blood disorder due to a point mutation in \nthe beta-globin gene resulting in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the \n6th amino acid, was first described over 100 years ago.1–3 Since then, the complex \npathophysiology has been elucidated from simply the red blood cell to \na multicellular event to include the blood vessel itself.3–5 This hemoglobin (Hb) \ngene defect is responsible for serious and life-threatening complications of hemo -\nlytic anemia, inflammation, an impaired immunity to encapsulated organis"}

In fact, 22% of deaths associated with \nSCD complications are preceded by a painful crisis.8 More specifically , acute chest \nsyndrome (ACS) has been one of the most devastating SCD complications with \na high mortality rate if there is a delay in diagnosis or mismanagement across all \nage groups. As such, there is a heightened awareness of ACS among healthcare \nproviders, specifically those in the acute care/emer gency setting. We want to help \nproviders shift beyond ACS to a more comprehensive management approach by \nhighlighting the social barriers to quality of care and the other complex, yet elusive, \nsevere and potentially life-threatening complications of SCD.\nThe management of SCD is finally transforming into a more comprehensive \nand diverse approach. Blood therapy and pain treatment were the mainstay of \nsupport therapy until 1998 when Hydroxyurea (HU) became the only Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved drug that targeted the molecular \npathogenesis.

Currently , there are over 30 novel pharma -\nceutical agents being studied and 3 have recently been FDA \napproved.1,3,9–11 New targets for drug development in SCD \ninclude adhesion, antioxidation, inflammation, fetal Hb induc -\ntion beyond HU, anti-sickling, anticoagulation, and opiate \nsparing drugs. In addition, we have expanded our approach \nfrom supportive care to curative procedures such as bone \nmarrow transplant, gene therapy , and gene editing.\nUntil recently , the management of SCD has focused on \nthe pathophysiology of the disease with less emphasis on \naddressing the complex social hardships which ultimately \nexists as barriers to quality care and management. Individuals with sickle cell disease navigate their lives \nthrough the hardships of associated complications such as \nacute chest syndrome and painful vaso-occlusive events \nwhile also facing a barrage of social barriers to quality care \nsuch as the transition from pediatric to adult care and health \ndisparities. Now is the time to recognize that there is a need \nfor a national movement to eliminate these barriers in order \nto truly ensure that the unmet social and medical needs are \nbeing addressed in the sickle cell population. Our goal is to \nreview the management of the systemic complications of \nSCD beyond acute chest syndrome, pipeline novel agents, \nand health disparity gaps in order to help the health care \nsystem have a more heightened awareness of the underlying \nand elusive complications that if remain overlooked in the \nshadows of ACS may cause harm to individuals living with \nsickle cell disease.\nFigure 1 Pathoph ysiology of sickle cell disease. \nNotes: Reprinted from Rees DC, Williams TN, Gladwin MT.

A recent article in the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine (NEJM) highlighted racism \nand solutions in the US and its effect on SCD.12 In the \nUnited States (US), the majority of people with sickle cell \ndisease have a 30-year gap in life expectancy compared to \nthe general population and are of African heritage, while \non the other hand, there is a lower incidence in people of \nHispanic, South Asian, South European, and Middle \nEastern descent who are also affected.7 These statistics \nplay an important factor in the way those living with \nSCD experience real-life consequences of the health dis-\nparities that exist in our healthcare system.\nThe lack of national awareness, funding for research, \ntherapeutic development, and social services for SCD in \ncomparison to other conditions that are prevalent to a more \nuniversal racial demographic such as asthma, heart dis-\nease, breast cancer , colon cancer , and diabetes supports \nsystemic racism as an underlying issue.13 In fact, even \namong rare diseases this is true. The genetically acquired, \nlife-threatening impact that SCD has on African \nAmericans is similar to the impact that Cystic Fibrosis \n(CF) has on Caucasian Americans.

Transfusion exerts its \neffect by dilution of Hb-S containing red blood cells (thereby \ndecreasing the percentage of the abnormal Hb S), and increas -\ning the oxygen carrying capacity of blood.60 Therapeutic blood \ntransfusions have been used for several indications such as: \nACS, stroke, acute symptomatic anemia, aplastic crisis, splenic \nand hepatic sequestration, sickle hepatopathy , central retinal \nartery occlusion, and multisystem organ failure. Several ran-\ndomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of pro-\nphylactic/chronic blood transfusions in primary and secondary \nstroke prevention, pre-operative management, and \npregnancy .61–67\nIn addition to the above indications, providers have \nalso utilized blood transfusions to alleviate other sickle \ncell disease complications, though not supported by con-\ncrete evidence. Before embarking on a chronic blood \ntransfusion regimen with a patient, the potential benefits \nmust be weighed against risks such as iron overload, red \ncell alloimmunization, transfusion reactions, and blood- \nborne viral infections.\nFDA Approved Drugs\nThere are currently 4 FDA approved drugs for sickle cell \ndisease, most gaining approval since 2017.\nHydroxyurea\nHydroxyurea, approved in 1998, was the first FDA- \napproved drug for sickle cell disease.

Its mechanism of action is \nnot completely understood, but it is known to induce fetal \nhemoglobin (Hb F), which in turn inhibits intracellular Hb \nS polymerization and prevents sickling within the red \nblood cells.70 In addition to increased Hb F synthesis and \ndecreased Hb S polymerization, effects include increased \nHb synthesis, decreased neutrophil count, hemolysis, RBC \nmembrane damage, endothelial cell activation and adhe -\nsion, to mention a few.71\nEndari (l-Glutamine)\nL-glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid; during \nperiods of stress and severe illness, the body’ s production \nbecomes insufficient.

NAD and its \nreduced form, NADH are involved in maintaining redox \nbalance and sickle red cells have a low redox ratio com-\npared to normal red cells.72 The mechanism of action of \nl-glutamine in SCD is not fully understood but it has been \nshown to increase NADH in sickle RBCs, which is \nbelieved to reduce oxidative stress.72 L-glutamine gained \nFDA approval in 2017 based on a randomized trial that \ndemonstrated significantly reduced pain crises and hospi -\ntalizations in the drug group.72 It is approved for sickle \ncell patients of all genotypes, age 5 years and above.

Acute chest syndrome remains the leading cause of \nmortality and must be taken keenly . However , various other \nsickle cell complications deserve attention, in order to ensure \nthe wellbeing of the patient as a whole and improve their \nquality of life. Other complications that may lead to long- \nterm comorbidities should not be overlooked. Whether it is \nacute chest syndrome, pain, or a social challenge like reduced \nquality of care due to racial discrimination, there is a need to \nlook beyond the usual, and shift focus to a more comprehen -\nsive approach to the patient.\nMultidisciplinary management as with management of \nleg ulcers or the pregnant sickle cell patient should be \nemphasized, so as to attain more favorable outcomes. \nReproductive counseling can generate a profound impact \non the burden of sickle cell disease. Interventions as sim-\nple as a routine annual ophthalmologic exam to rule out \nsickle cell retinopathy can have grave consequences if \nneglected in a subgroup of patients. Cerebrovascular \nevents should be promptly followed up with intense reha-\nbilitation to preserve residual gross and fine motor func-\ntioning. Updated vaccinations, to provide added protection \nagainst encapsulated organisms should be ensured. \nRoutine health maintenance as in the general population, such as yearly flu vaccines, colonoscopies, and mammo -\ngrams should be highly encouraged as well.\nIt is refreshing that several novel agents are in the \npipeline, to deal with the underlying cause of sickle cell \ndisease.

Acute pain \nin SCD arises from unpredictable and recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs),3 requiring \nhospitalization, diminishes quality of life, and may reduce survival.4 In addition, the \nmajority of sickle patients also suffer from fluctuating levels of chronic pain.5 The constant \nnature of pain in SCD can be disabling for many patients.\nWith few viable alternatives to opioids, sickle patients are caught between the tension of a \nnation struggling to slow the opioid epidemic and pain. Rampant fear of addiction and \noverdose – opioid-phobia – has led to increased difficulty in accessing opioids for patients \nwith SCD. In this review, we outline the existing knowledge and lacunae regarding opioid \nuse in SCD and highlight developments in targeting sickle pain with mechanism-based \ntranslational therapies.\nOpioids in SCD:\nCurrent status of opioids and lacunae requiring attention:\nThe National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommends aggressive opioid \ntherapy for treatment of acute VOC-induced pain and includes opioids in the treatment \nstrategy for chronic pain.6 The unique and unpredictable nature of pain in SCD often \nnecessitates the use of opioids for adequate analgesia.

Given the relative \nabsence of clinical evidence and challenges inherent in clinical studies on pain and SCD, \nstudies of translational models of SCD have helped provide insight into some of the disease \nspecific adverse effects of opioids.\nOpioid-induced Organ dysfunction:\nWe previously observed that clinical doses of morphine can worsen renal pathology, impair \nrenal function, and result in albuminuria in sickle mice.9,10 Renal complications which may \nprogress to end-stage renal disease are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD.\n11,12 An examination of whether opioids may contribute to nephropathy in patients warrants \nfurther study. In addition, hemin-induced acute lung injury in sickle mice is mediated by \ntoll-like receptor-4 (TLR4).13 Endothelial TLR4 signaling is also associated with hemolysis-\ninduced VOC in sickle mice.14 Morphine stimulates TLR4 activity and endothelial-specific \nmitogenic signaling and therefore, may worsen pre-existing endothelial vasculopathy and \norgan dysfunction leading to retinopathy, acute lung injury, and cerebral stroke.15,168 \nMorphine induced pruritus is another common feature in sickle patients.13,14,17 These \npreclinical observations require validation to prevent the adverse sequelae of opioid use \nshould they occur clinically.

Mice with SerpinA3N gene knockout demonstrated \nincreased hypersensitivity compared to control mice.117 SerpinA3N protein was also found \nto be downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of BERK sickle mice compared to \ncontrol mice which may contribute to increased hypersensitivity in SCD.118 In addition, \nSerpinA1, a gene that encodes for alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein which targets elastase, \nis also downregulated in sickle mice.119 This elastase-AAT complex is highly upregulated \nduring acute chest syndrome (ACS) and VOC in sickle patients.120,121 These studies suggest \nthat the balance between proteases and protease inhibitors may be shifted in favor of the \nformer in SCD, contributing to neuropathic pain and organ damage.\nPotential Treatments: Potential treatments include using an exogenous elastase inhibitor \nto decrease hypersensitivity in the DRG. SerpinA3N knockout mice that were treated with a \nleukocyte elastase inhibitor, Sivelestat, showed reduced mechanical pain without altered \nnociceptive sensitivity.117 Sivelestat has also been used clinically for acute lung injury in \nJapan and has been shown to improve outcomes and decrease duration of systemic \ninflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).122,123 These studies highlight the potential for \nelastase inhibitors in treating pain and organ damage in SCD.\nSignaling Pathway Inhibitors:\nCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is multifunctional protein kinase \nthat is a key component of calcium signaling pa"}

We \nfound that use of Duloxetine, a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor \n(SNRI), ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia in male and female sickle mice (manuscript under \nrevision).137 This effect was retained throughout the nine-day treatment period without the \ndevelopment of tolerance.

The study \nhighlights the potential of utilizing patient reported outcomes to guide identification of novel \nbiomarkers of pain.\nConclusion:\nOpioids are the first-line therapy for treating pain in SCD, but little is actually known about \ntheir side-effects specific to SCD. Even more concerning is that in the absence of viable \nalternatives to opioids, patients face many barriers to their access. The presence of \nlongstanding biases in healthcare providers, fueled by the ongoing opioid epidemic, and the \nstigma associated with SCD continues to complicate pain treatment. It is evident that more \nrigorous education is urgently needed across all levels of medical training – sickle pain \ncarries its own complexities that necessitate a different standard of care. However, major \nlacunae exist in the understanding of side-effects of opioids and alternatives for treating pain \nin SCD.

Recent technological advancements in the \napplication of facial expression readouts and qEEG offer hope to effectively quantify sickle \npain and prevent observer bias.\nYet, there remain challenges in carrying out effective clinical studies in the sickle \npopulation. Pain is a widespread feature, and one that does not disappear during clinical trial \nperiods. For this reason, patients are almost always on pain medication, and so a true \nplacebo-controlled trial is difficult to achieve. Given these challenges, it is essential that we \nmake use of robust pre-clinical humanized mouse models which closely recapitulate pain \nfeatures of SCD. Pre-clinical findings should be translated in clinical trials to optimize \nnewer therapies which can either prevent pain from being evoked and/or treatment of \nexistent pain without significant side-effects.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the NIH Grants U18 EB029354 and HL147562 and Provost’s Research Initiative at the \nUniversity of California, Irvine, to KG.

REQUEST BLOOD MATCHING\nOnce you know your antigens, they need to be matched \nwith the antigens of the donor’s blood to avoid a transfusion \nreaction during the blood transfusion. Ask your provider for \nblood that is matched for these antigens to which people \nwith SCD most commonly have transfusion reactions: \nC/c, E/e, and K red cell antigens .\nTRACK YOUR IRON LEVELS\nIf you have received more than 10 transfusions in your \nlifetime, you may be at risk for iron overload (too much iron \nin the body). Ask your provider for a ferritin blood test , \nwhich measures the amount of iron in your blood. If your \nferritin levels are high (greater than 1,000) and you receive \ntransfusions on a regular schedule, your provider should run \na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test that measures iron \nlevels in your liver. Your provider may also run an MRI that \nmeasures iron levels in your heart.\nTALK TO YOUR PROVIDER ABOUT YOUR \nTRANSFUSION OPTIONS \nIf you need regular transfusions, ask your provider about \nan automated red cell exchange , a transfusion process that \nremoves and replaces sickled cells with healthy blood. \nThis process may be preferred over a simple blood \ntransfusion during which healthy blood is added to blood \nwith sickled cells. An automated red cell exchange can lower \nyour risk for health problems, such as iron overload.\nLearn more about blood transfusions here: \nhttps://vimeo. com/showcase/7664222 IRON LEVELC/cC/c C/cC/cRECIPIENTDONOR"}

These blockages cause repeated episodes of severe pain, organ damage, serious infections, or even stroke.\nWhat Causes Sickle Cell Disease?\nSCD is inherited in the same way that people get \nthe color of their eyes, skin, and hair.\n• A person with SCD is born with it. \n• People cannot catch SCD from being around a \nperson who has it. \nWho Is Affected By Sickle \nCell Disease?\n• It is estimated that SCD affects 90,000 to 100,000 \npeople in the United States, mainly Blacks or African Americans.\n• The disease occurs among about 1 of every 500 Black or African-American births and among about 1 out of every 16,300 Hispanic-American births. \n• SCD affects millions of people throughout the world and is particularly common among those whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa; regions in the Western Hemisphere (South America, the Caribbean, and Central America); Saudi Arabia; India; and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy.\nWhat Health Problems Does Sickle \nCell Disease Cause?\nFollowing are some of the most common complications \nof SCD:\n“Pain Episode” or “Crisis”: Sickle cells don’t move easily \nthrough small blood vessels and can get stuck and clog blood flow. This causes pain that can start suddenly, be mild to severe, and last for any length of time.\nInfection: People with SCD, especially infants and \nchildren, are more likely to experience harmful infections such as flu, meningitis, and hepatitis.\nHand-Foot Syndrome: Swelling in the hands and feet, \noften along with a fever, is caused by the sickle cells getting stuck in the blood vessels and blocking the blood from flowing freely through the hands and feet.\nEye Disease: SCD can affect the blood vessels in the eye \nand lead to long term damage.\nAcute Chest Syndrome (ACS): Blockage of the flow of \nblood to the lungs can cause acute chest syndrome. ACS is similar to pneumonia; symptoms include chest pain, coughing, difficulty breathing, and fever. It can be \nlife threatening and should be treated in a hospital. \nStroke: Sickle cells can clog blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke. A stroke can result in lifelong disabilities and learning problems.\nCS 348718-A 07/24/2024"}

Treatment options are different for each person \ndepending on the symptoms. Treatments can include \nreceiving blood transfusions, maintaining a high fluid \nintake (drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water each day), \nreceiving IV (intravenous) therapy (fluids given into a \nvein) and medications to help with pain. \nFor severe SCD, a medicine call hydroxyurea might be \nrecommended. Research suggests that hydroxyurea \ncan reduce the number of painful episodes and the \nrecurrence of ACS. It also can reduce hospital stays \nand the need for blood transfusions among adults \nwho have SCD.\nIs There A Cure For Sickle \nCell Disease?\nTo date, there are only two potential cures for SCD: \na bone marrow or stem cell transplant and gene therapy. \nBone Marrow or Stem Cell Transplant\n• A bone marrow or stem cell transplant is a \nprocedure that takes healthy stem cells (blood \nforming cells) from a donor and puts them into \nsomeone whose bone marrow is not working \nproperly. These healthy stem cells cbause the bone \nmarrow to make new healthy cells. \n• Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are very risky \nand can have serious side effects, including death. \nFor the transplant to work, the bone marrow must \nbe a close match. For more information visit \nwww. cdc. gov/sicklecell .\nGene Therapy\nIn December 2023, the US Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) approved two cell-based gene \ntherapies for the treatment of SCD in patients 12 years \nand older:\n• Exagamglogene autotemcel (also known as exa-cel), \nor CASGEVY™\n• Lovotibeglogene autotemcel (also known as lovo-cel), \nor LYFGENIA™Both products are made from the patient’s own blood \nstem cells, which are modified and are given back as a \none-time, single-dose infusion as part of a blood stem cell \ntransplant. Prior to treatment, a patient’s own stem cells \nare collected, and then the patient must undergo high-\ndose chemotherapy, a process that removes cells from the \npatient’s bone marrow so they can be replaced with the \nmodified stem cells.\nMore information about both CASGEVY™ and \nLYFGENIA™ can be found on the FDA website at \nhttps://www. fda. gov/news-events/press-announcements/\nfda-approves-first-gene-therapies-treat-patients-sickle-\ncell-disease and the Sickle Cell Disease Association of \nAmerica website at https://www. sicklecelldisease. org."}

Postpartum care is important to help you stay \nhealthy physically, emotionally, and mentally as you recover and bond with your baby. Learn what steps you can take to have a healthy recovery.\nVisit your obstetrician/gynecologist or \nother reproductive healthcare provider and your sickle cell disease (SCD) provider within 3 to 4 weeks after delivery or sooner if your care providers think it is appropriate. Discuss with your SCD provider if any changes need to be made to your treatment plan. Some medicines are not recommended for use while breastfeeding. Get as much rest as possible. \nNewborns can wake every 2 to 3 hours for a feeding, making it hard to get long stretches of uninterrupted sleep. Ask for support from your partner, family, and friends so you can rest to stay healthy. \nKnow that your body will experience physical changes as it recovers.\n•If you had a vaginal birth, talk with your\ncare provider on ways to manage your pain\nas you heal.\n•If you had a cesarean delivery, it will take time\nfor the wound to heal. Follow your provider’sadvice regarding care of the wound.•Postpartum bleeding can last up to 6 weeks,\nwith bleeding often being the heaviest the\nfirst few days.\n•You may feel contraction-like pain during\nthe first few days after delivery.\nThings to Know About Your Newborn’s Health\n•Some babies born to women with SCD are born prematurely and may require care in the neonatal\nintensive care unit (NICU ).\n•If you required significant doses of opioids for pain management during your pregnancy, your newborncould possibly experience opioid withdrawal, a condition known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, and\nit may be one reason your baby may need care in the NICU.\n•All babies have a newborn screening blood test before leaving the hospital. This blood test looks for a\nnumber of conditions. The test will identify if your baby has a type of SCD or is a carrier for an abnormal\nhemoglobin gene (such as hemoglobin S or hemoglobin C). Babies born to mothers with SCD will haveat least one abnormal hemoglobin gene."}

Preconception care focuses \non taking steps before getting pregnant to increase the chances of having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. Women with sickle cell disease \n(SCD) are at greater risk for developing complications (health problems) \nduring pregnancy than women without SCD. For some women with SCD, \npregnancy can make their disease more severe, and treatments may need \nto be changed to help manage complications. This makes preconception \ncare especially important. Learn what steps you can take now to stay healthy during a future pregnancy. \nFind providers you trust who have experience caring for people with SCD. Ideally, your healthcare team \nshould include a SCD care provider and an obstetrician/gynecologist or other reproductive healthcare provider, and might also include specialists. \nConsider your future reproductive goals \nand if and when you want to have children. Discuss with your providers how best to achieve these goals.\nDiscuss and develop a support plan with \nyour partner, family, and employer on issues that may need to be considered when you become pregnant since you will have many medical appointments. Topics can include \nthe following:\n• Caring for other children or family members\n• Managing household chores\n• Managing work schedules with \nyour employerAsk your care team about testing for you \nand your partner to learn about the chance of having a child with SCD. Talk to a genetic counselor about the results to understand the chance of having a baby born with SCD and to help you think about your options for \nstarting a family . \nTalk with your obstetrician/gynecologist \nor other reproductive healthcare provider if you have been trying to get pregnant and have had unprotected sex for more than 6 months and are not pregnant. Many people experience fertility challenges, so talk with your provider to learn what options may be best for you."}

Your reproductive healthcare provider may \nrefer you to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist (an obstetrician/gynecologist specializing in complicated \nor high-risk pregnancies). If you live far from where this care is available, try to travel to a medical center for \na checkup and coordinate your care with your local care team as well. You might also ask whether a \ntelehealth visit for an initial consultation is a possibility. During your checkups with various reproductive \nhealthcare providers, be sure to do the following:\nBe sure your care provider examines the \nhealth of your eyes, lungs, heart, kidneys, \nliver, and hips to check for any complications \nthat can worsen during pregnancy. Talk to \nyour care team about managing your blood \ncounts, such as your hemoglobin level, and \ndevelop a pain management plan. \nShare a list of medicines that you take \nand ask if you need to stop, change, or \nreduce your dose before you start trying \nto get pregnant. You should discuss both \nprescription medicines (such as non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chelators, \nhydroxyurea, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, \nanticoagulants, and opioids) and all over-\nthe-counter medicines (including vitamin \nsupplements) that you take regularly or on \noccasion, whether they are taken for your \nSCD or another reason.

Regular \nprenatal care is important for everyone. It is especially important for \nwomen with sickle cell disease (SCD) because they are at greater risk for \ndeveloping complications (health problems) during pregnancy than women \nwithout SCD. Pain crises and other SCD complications can become more \nsevere or increase in frequency while you are pregnant, but regular care \ncan help you manage and prevent complications. Learn what steps you can \ntake to help stay healthy throughout your pregnancy.\nSchedule regular medical appointments. In \naddition to your prenatal care provider and \nyour SCD provider, your healthcare team \nmight also include a maternal-fetal medicine \nspecialist (an obstetrician/gynecologist \nspecializing in complicated or high-risk \npregnancy). You will need to be seen for \nprenatal care every month, or more often as \ndelivery approaches, to monitor your health \nand the health of your baby. You also might \nneed additional ongoing visits with your \nSCD provider and other specialists.\nProtect yourself while pregnant against \ninfections , such as flu, COVID-19, and \nwhooping cough. Review your current \nvaccination record with your care team to \nmake sure you are up to date on all needed \nvaccines (shots). Vaccines are safe for \npeople with SCD, and most are also safe to \nuse during pregnancy . Additional vaccines \nare recommended for people with SCD to \nhelp prevent harmful infections. Ask your care team about testing for you \nand your partner to learn about the chance \nof having a child with SCD. Your care team \nmay also discuss tests to diagnose SCD \nwhile your baby is in your womb. These \ntests can check for genetic abnormalities \nin the baby. Talk to a genetic counselor \nabout the results of any tests that are \ndone (mother, father, or fetal testing) to \nunderstand the chance of having a baby \nborn with SCD.\nTalk with your care team about your pain, \npain management plan, medicine doses, \nand how your medicines might affect your \nbaby and how changes in your medication \nmight affect you. If you regularly take opioid \nmedicines for pain, your newborn might \nexperience neonatal abstinence syndrome \n(a withdrawal syndrome that can occur in \nnewborns after being exposed to certain \ndrugs or medicines during pregnancy).\nTry to avoid extreme temperatures, high altitudes, dehydration, and other conditions or activities that \ncan trigger pain for you."}
